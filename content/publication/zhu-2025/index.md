abstract: 'Food image recognition holds significant application potential in the field
  of computer vision. However, due to performance constraints on mobile devices, the
  scale and computational overhead of models face notable limitations, making effective
  deployment on mobile platforms challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes
  a lightweight Dual-Path Feature Aggregation Network (DPFA-Net), designed to enhance
  the performance of food recognition tasks through efficient local and global feature
  extraction strategies. Specifically, the DPFA architecture comprises two core modules:
  the GhostBottleneck module for local feature encoding and the Position Mamba Vision
  Transformer (PM-ViT) module for global modeling. In this work, the GhostBottleneck
  module is utilized to extract local features from images. Furthermore, by integrating
  the Mamba structure with the Separable Self-Attention (SSA) structure, we construct
  the Mamba Attention (MA) module, which replaces the traditional Attention mechanism
  in Vision Transformers to build the PM-ViT module, enabling the capture of global
  features in food images. The redesigned DPFA-Net effectively fuses local and global
  information, achieving efficient food image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate
  that, on the ETHZ Food-101, Vireo Food-172, and UEC Food-256 benchmark datasets,
  DPFA-Net achieves Top-1 accuracies of 91.46%, 91.59%, and 75.33%, respectively,
  while reducing approximately 8.4M parameters. Compared to MobileViTv2, DPFA-Net
  improves performance by 1.5%-3.9%, fully validating the effectiveness and superiority
  of the DPFA architecture.'
