abstract: Recognizing fruit and vegetable is crucial for improving processing efficiency,
  automating harvesting, and facilitating dietary nutrition management. The diverse
  applications of fruit and vegetable recognition require deployment on end devices
  with limited resources, such as memory and computing power. The key challenge lies
  in designing lightweight recognition algorithms. However, current lightweight methods
  still rely on simple CNN-based networks, which fail to deeply explore and specifically
  analyze the unique features of fruit and vegetable images, resulting in unsatisfactory
  recognition performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight
  recognition network termed Channel Grouping Vision Transformer (CGViT). CGViT utilizes
  a channel grouping mechanism and half-convolution to enhance feature extraction
  capability while reducing complexity. This design enables the model to capture three
  discriminative types of features from images. Subsequently, the Transformer is employed
  for feature fusion and global information extraction, ultimately creating an efficient
  neural network model for fruit and vegetable recognition. The proposed CGViT approach
  achieved recognition accuracies of 71.26%, 99.99%, 98.92%, and 61.33% on four fruit
  and vegetable datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MobileViTV2,
  MixNet, MobileNetV2). The maximum memory usage during training is only 6.48GB, which
  is merely 13.8% of that required by state-of-the-art methods(MobileViTv2). The fruit
  and vegetable recognition model proposed in this study offers a more profound and
  effective solution, providing valuable insights for future research and practical
  applications in this domain. The code is available at https://github.com/Axboexx/CGViT.
