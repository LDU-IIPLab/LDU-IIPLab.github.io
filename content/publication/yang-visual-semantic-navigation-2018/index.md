abstract: 'How do humans navigate to target objects in novel scenes? Do we use the
  semantic/functional priors we have built over years to efficiently search and navigate?
  For example, to search for mugs, we search cabinets near the coffee machine and
  for fruits we try the fridge. In this work, we focus on incorporating semantic priors
  in the task of semantic navigation. We propose to use Graph Convolutional Networks
  for incorporating the prior knowledge into a deep reinforcement learning framework.
  The agent uses the features from the knowledge graph to predict the actions. For
  evaluation, we use the AI2-THOR framework. Our experiments show how semantic knowledge
  improves performance significantly. More importantly, we show improvement in generalization
  to unseen scenes and/or objects. The supplementary video can be accessed at the
