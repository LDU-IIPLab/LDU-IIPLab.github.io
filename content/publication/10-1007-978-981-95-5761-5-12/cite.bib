 abstract = {Existing asymmetric retrieval methods primarily rely on aligning global features to transfer semantic information. However, they often struggle to convey knowledge effectively across different network layers, limiting fine-grained alignment in feature representation spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a Cross-Layer and Selective Distillation (CLSD) framework. It first introduces a semantic-aware cross-layer feature distillation mechanism, where an attention-guided soft layer alignment strategy enables the student model to dynamically select and integrate the most relevant semantic knowledge from multiple intermediate teacher layers, based on its own layer's semantic requirements. This alleviates the knowledge transfer challenges arising from architectural asymmetry. Furthermore, considering the importance of ranking consistency in fine-grained food image retrieval, we propose a decoupled differential relation distillation approach based on unambiguous samples. This method emphasizes the teacher model's discriminative power and ranking behavior on unambiguous samples, while filtering out noisy signals from ambiguous ones. As a result, the student learns more reliable relative relationships between samples, ensuring consistency in ranking order between query and gallery features. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques, highlighting its effectiveness in asymmetric fine-grained retrieval tasks.},
